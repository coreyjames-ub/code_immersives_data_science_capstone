7 - Is the standard deviation, mean, mode, median higher for men? Calulate the % difference
8 - Write up- Do you think there is salary bias?
Part 2 - c
The salary grades of 5 - 7 are considered executive salary grades - Exempt or EXECUTIVE
The salary grades of 1 - 4 are considered - Non-exempt (Hourly) - NON-EXECUTIVE

2 - Calculate the mean, mode, median, and standard deviation of the salaries of each salary grade
3 - Calculate the mean, mode, median, and standard deviation of the salaries of EXEMPT employees
4 - Calculate the mean, mode, median, and standard deviation of the salaries of NON-EXEMPT employees
5 - Create pie charts of the employee status of EXEMPT count by gender and NON-EXEMPT count by gender
6 - Create scatter plots of salary grade by mean salary
7 - Create a scatter plots of salary grade by mean salary for men
8 - Create a scatter plots of salary grade by mean salary for women
9 - Create a horizontal bar chart of EXEMPT employees by mean salary for men and women (1 chart)
10- Create a horizontal bar chart of NON-EXEMPT employees by mean salary for men and women (1 chart)
7 - Sort and output every Employee all columns by salary grade by name for every salary grade

In the case of people with the same last name and first name generate a new number
No duplication
